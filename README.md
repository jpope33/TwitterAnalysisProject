# Twitter Analysis Project

Hey guys, this code seems to working at the basic level we described. It can analyze the timeframes a given user tweets for at most 20 past tweets.


Maybe we can start adding things to address here
1. Doesn't run from terminal
2. Create JSON objects to pass to Web client
3. Determine what type of statistics we'd like to present
4. Should we save the downloaded tweets to a csv/database for easier access?

## Web client

To set up the web client, ensure you have node.js and NPM installed, and run:

```bash
cd client

npm install
```

To build and start the server, run:
```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

## Application
Must install python3-tk:  on Linux, this is done with:
apt-get install python3-tk

To start GUI run App.py first
